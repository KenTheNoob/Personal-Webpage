                <p>	&emsp;&emsp;My name is Kenneth Cheng. I am a sophomore at NJIT and am majoring in
                    computer science. I am from Roselle Park and am dorming at Laurel Hall. 
                    So far I have learned Python and Java and hope to learn C++ for more efficient 
                    video game development. My favorite subjects are computer science
                    (obviously), math, and physics. This is because I find these subjects the most 
                    useful in my everyday life. Alongside IT, I am currently taking Psychology, 
                    General Chemistry II, Introduction to Computer Science II, and Calculus IIIA. 
                    During my free time at NJIT, I usually play video games such as Genshin Impact 
                    and Smash Bros or watch anime.

                    &emsp;&emsp;While my hobbies are usually short-lived, some things I have dabbled
                    in are ping-pong, Rubix's Cubes, and card throwing. My favorite food is dumplings
                    and my favorite snacks are sour patches and cheez-its. I play the piano
                    and alto-saxophone with one of my favorite songs being Megalovania.
                    In order to stay in shape, I make sure to do pushups and sit-ups every day. I 
                    view myself as an introvert who usually likes to avoid standing out. This is my 
                    first online webpage, so Hello World!
